# Magic Memory Game

Project part of an online React course. I chose to do this project to practice my React skills. Key project functionalities:

  - Start a new game.
  - If the two cards you select to not match they flip again so that you cannot see them.
  - If the two cards you selet match, they stay visible.
  - Once you matched all cards the game finishes and you can start a new game.
